## Design Rationale
# Singleton Design Pattern
Global Config files only have and need a single instances each,
this ensures things like API Key access, settings specified in them, and the methods used
will only be accessed from that one instance.
# Facade Design Pattern
Interactions with the system is converged behind CLIs, 
# Observer
